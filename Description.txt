In this folder is the code in MATLAB for the exploration of an .OBJ file generated by the structured sensor ST01.
This scan allows:
1-Project in two dimensions the views of the object in 360 degrees.
2-Detect facial characteristics of the scanned subject (eyes, nose and mouth), using own detectors of MATLAB.
3- Define the intrinsic coordinates of the nasion.
4-Use custom detectors for the detection of ears.
5-Define the pre-auricular points from ear detections.
6-Programmatically control the movement of the mouse and the click event to reproject 3D fiducials into intrinsic coordinates.
In addition, the folder contains the images used as positive samples to generate the ear detectors, the negative samples, the ground truth variables and the detectors defined for different values ??of the probability of occurrence of false positives.
There is also the code used to generate the detectors.
